## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The project, generated with `ost init --template renderer --name lotus`
  (OpenStrata 0.23.14, template 0.5.4): the host-neutral core, the Vulkan
  backend, the headless runner, the standalone viewport and the `hdLotus`
  Hydra adapter, all drawing the template's bootstrap triangle.
- A `hydra` build intent in `openstrata.toml` that builds the Hydra adapter.
- Documentation: the design policy and integration scope; the project
  layout; the capability matrix and measured configurations; the roadmap;
  the building guide; and the first `ost` dogfooding report.

### Changed

- `adapters/headless/main.cpp` is ASCII-only. One em dash in a comment made
  MSVC print that file's `/showIncludes` notes in a form Ninja did not
  recognize on a Japanese host, so the headless runner recorded no header
  dependencies and a header edit did not rebuild it.
